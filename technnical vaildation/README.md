# IBNS
Introduction

IBNS is based on a dataset called Business Intent and Network Slicing Correlation Dataset (BINS) within the context of intent-based networking. This dataset primarily includes user business intent description data, business intent annotation data, and data correlating business intents with network slices. We have validated the data and quality of BINS using natural language processing techniques based on named entity recognition, confirming its reliability and applicability. As the latest dataset for network intent recognition, the deployment of BINS will aid in the development of intent-based network management systems.

Regarding the Code for Validating BINS

This is a named entity recognition method based on BERT, which extracts key entities and related parameters from unstructured text using named entity recognition. The model can effectively identify the user's network intent.
